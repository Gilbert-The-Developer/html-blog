    <p> In this post , lets focus on HTML is all about ,and why you too should learn it</p>
    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language). </p>
    <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>The opening tag</li>
            <li>The closing tag</li>
            <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol>
